- This screencast provides an overview of the various reactor simulation blocks and Aspen Plus software.
- There are seven reactor simulator blocks in Aspen. RStoic and RYield are yield-based models meaning they simply require a material balance and a conversion value. Therefore, the model does not take into account equilibrium or kinetics of the reaction. 
- The RStoic model can simulate a reaction where all stoichiometric coefficients are known while RYield only requires the outlet composition, An example of a reaction where an RYield model would be appropriate to use is the cracking of cool.
- REquil and RGibbs are equilibrium-based models and are used for reversible reactions. REquil is a simpler model and can calculate both the chemical and phase equilibrium of a reaction. RGibbs is useful in situations in which not all the reactants or reactions are known, such as in petroleum refining. RGibbs determines the outlet stream composition by minimizing the Gibbs free energy of the system.
- RCSTR, RPlug, and RBatch are all kinetic-based models, meaning the kinetics of the reaction must be known. Additionally, all three can be used to calculate the reactor duty. The most common rate law used in Aspen Plus is the power law method.
- RCSTR model is a continuous, stirred-tank tank reactor and can have multiple inlets and different phase outlet streams.
- RPlug models a plug flow reactor or PFR in which the length and diameter need to be specified.
- RBatch can model batch processes in which the cycle time is known. RBatch models can work in conjunction with holding tanks to model continuous processes.
