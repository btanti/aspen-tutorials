- This screencast introduces Aspen plus and describes the various property methods available for use in the software.
<<<<<<< HEAD
- In industry, engineers typically use software programs, such as Aspen Plus, to solve complicated problems as hand calculations are prone to human error and require more time.
- Aspen Plus is a process simulator that allows you to predict the behavior of a process at a finer granularity by using basic engineering relationships, such as mass and energy balances, thermodynamic principles and phase and chemical equilibrium.

- The software package includes sets of predefined mathematical relationships and equations, and allows for the input of  custom user-defined FORTRAN subroutines.
- ASPEN plus enables process engineers to model reactors, fractionation systems, and more, and both determine and optimize crucial process design parameters
- Before developing a flow sheet or running a simulation, it is important to select an appropriate property method to analyze your process, as certain chemical phenomena are more accurately represented in one versus another depending on the nature of the process.
- A property method is simply a set of calculation procedures for chemical and thermodynamic properties like fugacity, enthalpy, entropy and volume. We will go over five of the most commonly used methods here, along with examples of applications for each type.

# IDEAL
This property method is based on Henry's and Raoult's law, and relies on several assumptions of ideality. 

The activity coefficient is assumed to be 1, and the ideal gas equation of state is used. Liquid molar volumes are estimated according to the Rackett model.  Transport phenomena is modeled based on empirical equations fit to experimental data. 

This is appropriate for systems at low pressure or vacuum or systems at high temperature, where low mol fractions of liquid are present.

# Liquid fugacity and K-value correlations:

BK10: based on Braun K-10 K-values correlations for multicomponent oil mixtures. Suitable for purely aliphatic or purely aromatic mixtures, with boiling points between 450K and 700K.

Recommended for systems containing hydrocarbons and light gases. Suitable for modeling crude towers, vacuum towers, some parts of the ethylene process.

The following utilize:
  

  ​	•Redlich-Kwong equation of state for vapor phase properties

​	•Lee-Kesler equation of state for liquid and vapor enthalpy

​	•American Petroleum Institute method

## CHAO-SEA

​	200< T<  533 

​	K 0.5  < Tri<  1.3

​	Trm <  0.93

​	P  <  140 atm

## GRAYSON/GRAYSON2

 Reasonable results between 60F to 800F and up to 3000 psia.

​	Grayson-Streed correlation for reference state fugacity coefficients

​	TRAPP model for transportthat 

​	Scatchard-Hildebrand model for activity coefficients


## MXBONNEL

Low pressure applications, similar to BK10 but with the Maxwell Bonnell vapor pressure method used instead for hydrocarbon pseudocomponents.

​	  - low pressure, vacuum applications.

​	  - Maxwell-Bonnell model for vapor pressure to compute liquid fugacity coefficient; ideal gas for vapor fugacity coefficients

​	  - TRAPP transport

# EOS for high pressure hydrocarbon applications

##  Flexible and predictive equations of state
The Flexible and Predictive Equation-of-State property methods use various equations of state from chemical engineering thermodynamics for mixtures of polar and non-polar components, the most popular being Peng-Robinson and RK-Soave.

## Petroleum-Tuned EOS Property Methods:

Suitable for gas-processing, refinery, and petrochemical applications. Sample applications include gas plants,crude towers, and ethylene plants.



# Activity Coefficient Models

## WILSON


## NRTL
Models vapor-liquid and liquid-liquid equilibrium of strongly nonideal solutoins very well, and is suitable for most combinations of polar and nonpolar compounds. Suitable for most operating conditions with the exception of those near the critical temperature of a component

## UNIQUAC
Includes more detailed assumptions of molecular geometry and entropy contributions to determine phase equilibria.

## UNIFAC
Works with group-group interations rather than molecule-molecule interactions.


# Other
In addition to the property methods we have detailed, ASPEN also offers specific property methods for processes involving electrolytes, solids, and steam.
