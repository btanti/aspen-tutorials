- This screencast provides an overview of the solids processing blocks available for use in Aspen plus software.
- ASPEN supports several solids operations:
  - 1)  The crystallizer, which produces crystals from solution based on solubility,
  - the crusher, which mechanically processes solids into smaller particle sizes,
  - Screen, which mechanically separates particles by particle size,
  - Single stage  washer, or SWash for short, which recovers dissolved components in entrained liquid using a washing liquid
  - Counter-current decanter, or CCD for short, which models multistage recovery of dissolved components in entrained liquid using a washing liquid,
  - Dryer, which evaporates liquid from wet solids,
  - Granulator, which increases particle size
  - Classifier, which separates solids based on settling velocity
  - FluidBed, which models fluidized bed units. * More specific? *

We will go over the crystallizer and dryer in detail in the following modules.

- ASPEN also supports several solids separator blocks:
  - The Cyclone separator, which models the removal of particulate from gas
  - Venturi scrubber, or VScrub for short, which atomizes scrubbing liquid to separate solids from gases,
  - Centrifuge filter, or CFuge for short, which facilitates sedimentation through centrifugal force,
  - Rotary vacuum filter, or Filter for short, which separates slurry components after passing it through a vacuum chamber,
  - Cross-flow  filter, or CFFilter forshort, which selectively filters solid particulate in a tangentially flowing liquid,
  - Hydrocyclone, or HyCyc for short, which selectively separates slurry through centrifugral force,
  - FabFI, which deposits solid particulate onto fabric material
  - Electrostaticprecipitator, or ESP for short, which removes unwanted particulate in gas through electric charging.

We will go over Cyclone and Filter in detail in the following modules.
