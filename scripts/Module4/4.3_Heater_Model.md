- This screencast details how to use two heater models to model a heat exchanger in Aspen Plus software.
- To begin open your detailed heat exchanger simulations.
- Go to the simulation environment and delete the HeatX block.
- Create two heater models.
- One represents a cold side and one represents the hot side.
- Connect the inlet and outlet streams appropriately.
- Connect the heat stream from the hot heater to the cold heater unit.
- Press the blue next arrow to enter information about the cold side key.
- To specify the out temperatures: 48.25 degrees Celsius and the outlet pressure should be 10 bar.
- Press the blue next arrow. Enter information of the hot side heater. 
- Specify that there is no pressure drop and that the outlet vapor fraction is 0.
- Also specify the valid species as vapor liquid dirty water.
- Now run the simulation.
- Ckucj on the cold side heater results to see the heat duty.
- Click on the hot side heater results.
- You can see the hot side is losing nearly an equivalent amount of heat through the heat stream.
- This discrepancy is due to the approximate value of the cold outlet temperature.
- It can be further refined with more precise specifications.
- Watch the following video in the YouTube playlist for an application of the concepts learned in chapter 4, Heat Exchangers,to a chlorobenzene production plan.
