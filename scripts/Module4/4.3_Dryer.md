- This screencast demonstrates how to model a dryer unit in Aspen plus software.

Convective Dryer Example:

- Suppose we want to model the drying of wet dolomite powder. 
- Open your Aspen simulation and begin a new flow sheet with metric units to start.
- Enter the components caco3, mgco3, water, and air. Set the component type of caco3 and mgco3 to solid.
- Go to methods and choose IDEAL as the property method. Run the property analysis and go to the simulation view.
- Go to the specifications menu under setup in the menu tree. Choose MIXCIPSD for the stream class.
- Next, go to the solids folder under setup in the menu tree. Select water as the moisture component.
- Expand the solids folder and go to the PSD menu. Create a geometric PSD mesh between 1 mm to 10mm.

- Create a dryer block with a feed stream, an inlet air stream, and respective outlet streams. 
- Enter the conditions for the feed stream in the CI Solid tab. The feed is coming in at 95 degrees celsius and 1 bar with 20 wt% water, 40 wt% caco3, and 40 wt% mgco3, and a mass flow rate of 33 kg/min.
- This feed composition equates to 80% dolomite to 20% water on a wet basis.
- Now enter the particle size distribution in the same tab:
  - 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.2, 0.2, 0.4, 0.2 with 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1 respectively
- The inlet air stream is coming in at 200 degrees celsius and 1 bar with a moisture content of .02 wt%, and a mass flow rate of 170 kg/min

- Next, enter the dryer specifications. We are operating a continuous, convective dryer with a length of 6 meters and solids residence time 
of 3 hours. The drying gas will flow co-currently with the feed. 
- Go to the mass/heat transfer tab and specify the mass transfer coefficient as .0005 m/sec.
- Go to the drying curve tab and specify the equililbrium moisture content as .05 and critical moisture content as .1 both on a dry basis.
- Enter the following data for the normalized drying curve:
  - 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.35, 0.65, 0.85, 1  with 0, 0.1, 0.5, 0.8, 0.9, 0.95, and 1 respectively.

  - 4-5, 5-6, 6-8, and 8-10  with 20, 20, 40, and 20 respectively (what is this for?)

- Run the simulation and go to the stream results. 
- The outlet stream is now only 5% water, containing mostly solid caco2 and mgco3.
- Go to the dryer results for more detailed information on the dryer operation. Here you can see the calculated dryer duty,
evaporation rate, and exhaust temperature, among other metrics.
