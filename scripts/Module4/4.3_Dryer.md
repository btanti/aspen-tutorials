- This screencast demonstrates how to model a dryer unit in Aspen plus software.
- Suppose we want to model the drying of wet filter cake containing 
- Open your Aspen simulation and begin a new flow sheet using the Solid template, with metric units to start.
- Enter the components water, copper sulfate in solid form, copper pentahydrate insolid format, copper 2+ ion and sulfate 2- ion.
- Go to the simulation view.
