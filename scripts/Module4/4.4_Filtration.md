- This screencast demonstrates how to model a Filter in ASPEN plus software.

- Open the saved file from Chapter 4.2, crystallizers.
- Go to the solid separator tab and place the filter block on the flowsheet.
- Doubleclick the block.
- ASPEN supports several calculation modes for solid-liqiud separators, drum filters, belt filters and disc filters.
- The last three require input about the cake geometry and saturation, and the specific filtration model. 
- We will limit our filter model to a simple solid-liquid separator.
- The two specifications to consider are Fraction of Solids to
Solid Outlet and Fraction of Liquid to Liquid Outlet
- Run the simulation.
- A warning will pop up, as we did not explicitly set the particle size distribution in the CIPSD substream of the outlet.
This is normal, as we relied on ASPEN to implicitly determine this for us.
