- This screencast will continue to add on to the ethyl acetate plant example from Chapter 3.4.
- Recall that the reaction occurs at 55 degrees celsius.
- Suppose we would like to preheat the feed streams to the reactor using heat exchangers.
- Place two HeatX blocks on the flowsheet. Create a hot water stream for each, and connect the cold side fluid streams appropriately.
- Connect the hot side effluent of both heat exchangers to the reactor.
- For each hot water inlet stream, specify the temperature at 80 degrees celsius, pressure at 1 bar, and flow rate at 200 kg/min.
- For each heat exchanger block, leave the model fidelity as shortcut. Change the specification to cold stream outlet temperature
- Enter 55 dgrees celsius with a minimum temperature approach of 5 degrees celsius.
- Run the simulation and view the results.
- The results should be identical to those in Chapter 3.5, except for the temperature of the feed streams to the reactor.
