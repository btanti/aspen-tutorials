- This screencast will detail how to use a compressor simulator block in Aspen Plus software.
- To begin create a new simulation with English units. 
- Enter the process component as hydrogen and specify RK-SOAVE as the property method. 
- Run the property analysis and proceed to the simulation environment. 
- On the pressure changes tab, create a compressor and connect the inlet and outlet streams. 
- Label everything appropriately. 
- Click on the blue next arrow to enter information about the feed.
- Assume that hydrogen enters at 100 degrees Fahrenheit and 325 psi with a flow rate of 750 pound moles per hour. 
- Click on the blue next arrow to enter information about the compressor. 
- Choose the type as isentropic with a four-bar pressure change. For this simulation we will neglect efficiencies
- Run the simulation and view the results. 
- You can see that 77.6 horsepower is needed to increase the pressure by 4 bar. 
- You can also see that compressing a gas raises its temperature. Compressors will often have cooling systems to prevent overheating.
