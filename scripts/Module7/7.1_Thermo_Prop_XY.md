- This chapter will teach you various advanced principles in Aspen plus software. 
- This screencast focuses on finding service physical properties and generating TXY diagrams. 

- To begin, create a new simulation. 
- Enter the process components: water and methanol. 
- Choose a property method. Here we will use the WILSON property method. Run the property analysis.
- To view the thermophysical properties of these components, click on retrieve parameters in the top menu bar. 
- Press ok and then yes. 
- Aspen will generate a table that displays the freezing point, molecular weight, eccentric factor, boiling point, and critical points as well as various other thermophysical properties. 
- To create a TXY diagram, click on the binary button on the top menu and select TXY as the analysis type. Other options include PXY and Gibbs energy of mixing.
-  In the composition box, notice the overall range from 0 to 1 mole fraction. This can also be changed a mass fraction if desired. 
-  All other inputs are specified already, so you can click on the run analysis button. 
-  The TXY diagram will be displayed on the screen. 
-  Under analysis and the menu tree, click on binary 1. 
-  Now, click on the results tab to view the data in tabular form
-  For other plot options, click on the drop-down menu in the plot subsection at the top of the screen.
