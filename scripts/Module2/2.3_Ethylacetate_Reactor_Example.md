- This screencast applies the fundamentals within Chapter 2's Reactor Blocks to setup the reactor portion of an ethylacetate production plant in Aspen Plus.
- To begin, open the initial setup file from Chapter 1.5.
- We will use an REquil block to model our reaction. Change the temperature to 55 degrees C and the pressure to 1 bar.
- We will use the same reaction as in the previous module, Chapter 2.2. 
- Under the reactor block on the menu tree, and click the Reactions tab.
- Click new and enter the forward reaction.
- Ethanol + acetic acid goes to ethyl acetate in water.
- Assume the reaction is first order with respect to each of the reactants and zeroth order with respect to the products.
- Enter negative 1 and 1 for the coefficients and 1 in 0 for the exponents of your reactants and products respectively.
- Since we are directly modeling the reaction in the equilibrium reactor block itself, we do not need to specify the k values, as these will be generated for us.
- We also only need to specify the forward reaction.
- Run the simulation and view the results.
- The outlet stream is 67 wt% ethyl acetate, 8 wt% ethanol, 11 wt% acetic acid, and 14 wt% water.
- Save your file where it can be accessed later.
- Watch the following video in the Youtube playlist to continue the series.
