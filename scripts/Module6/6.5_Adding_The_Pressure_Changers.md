- This screencast will continue to add on to the ethyl acetate plant example from Chapter 5.3, Adding a Heat exchanger.
- Suppose our ethyl acetate plant is in an environment that is in fact lower than our intended operating pressure of 1 bar. 
- This may be due to minor losses in the feed fluid pipe due to transport from the supply tank, elevation, or other reasons.
- Let's assume our feed streams in fact are each 0.9 bar at the battery limit. 
- We will use pumps to increase the pressure to 1 bar. 
- Place two pumps on the flowsheet, and reconnect the feed streams to first enter the pump before the heat exchangers.
- Specify the discharge pressures as 1 bar.
- Run the simulation.
- The results should be identical to those in Chapter 5.3, barring the specifications of the initial feed streams.
