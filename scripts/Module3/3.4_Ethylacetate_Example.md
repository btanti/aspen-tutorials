 - In this screencast, we will build the first part of our ethylacetate process, which takes ethanol and acetic acid as inputs and outputs a 98 wt%
 - ethylacetate and 2% water stream.
 - We will begin from the example RGibbs reaction model built in chapter 2.2. 
 - We would first like to separate out our desired ethylacetate from the effluent of the reactor. Create a DSTWU model and connect all streams to the inputs and ouputs.
