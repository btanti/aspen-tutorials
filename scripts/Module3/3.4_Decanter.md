 - This screencast provides an overview of the Decanter block in Aspen plus software.
 - Create a new simulation with Metric units.
 - Enter the components toulene, methanol and water.
 - Go to the simulation view.
 - Click the separators tab  and place a decanter block on the flowsheet.
 - The decanter block has one inlet port, and two outlet ports representing the two liquid phases.
 - Create the inlet and oulet streams.
 - The feed stream comes in at 50 degrees celsius, 1 bar, and 200 kmol/hr.
 - The composition type is mol-fraction. Enter .37 for toluene, .49 for methanol, and .17 for water.
 - Run the simulation and view the stream results.
 - The initial feed stream  is separated into a toluene rich phase and a methanol rich phase.
