 - In this screencast, we will build on the first part of our ethylacetate process, which takes ethanol and acetic acid as inputs and outputs a stream of 98 wt%
 - ethylacetate and 2 wt% water.
 - We will begin from the reactor model built in Chapter 2.3
 - We would first like to separate out our desired ethylacetate from the effluent of the reactor.
 - Create a new RadFrac block. Connect the effluent stream of the reactor to the inlet of the column, and create the appropriate outlets treams.
 - Go to the RadFrac specifications under the menu tree.
 - Make sure the calculation type is Equilbrium.
 - - Change the number of stages to 23.
 - Choose a total condenser type. 
 - Change the operating specifications to reflux ratio, with a value of 3 on a mol ratio basis, and 
  the reboiler duty to 3500 kJ/sec.
 - Click on the streams tab. Change the feed stage to 12, with an on-stage convention, and make sure the bottoms is  at stage 23, and the distillate is at stage 1. 
 - Run the simulation and view the results.
 - Go to the pressure tab. Change the condenser pressure to 1  bar.
 - The distillate out the top is 85 wt% ethylacetate. We would like to increase this to 98%, and we will do so in the next module.
